From December 2019 to February 2022, I served as *Chair* of the [IEEE Student Branch at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology](https://www.facebook.com/ieeetec), where I worked closely with students to organize technical activities, foster collaboration, and strengthen engagement within the IEEE community at the university.
