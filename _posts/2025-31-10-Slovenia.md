This spring marks the beginning of an exciting chapter: combining a research internship in **Slovenia** with the opportunity to explore one of Europe’s most diverse and nature-rich countries. Based in a vibrant academic and research environment, my days are shaped by hands-on work, collaboration, and learning, while weekends invite exploration beyond the office.

From the charming streets of **Ljubljana** to the alpine landscapes of **Triglav National Park**, Slovenia offers a rare balance between innovation and nature. Evenings often end with walks along the Ljubljanica River, conversations over local food, and planning the next short escape — whether to the coast, the mountains, or a hidden village. Inspiration comes not only from work, but also from the rhythm of daily life in a new culture. 

#### Adventure highlights

- Exploring Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj  
- Discovering local cafés and cultural events  

Balancing structured research work with spontaneous travel has been both challenging and rewarding. Weekdays are filled with focused problem-solving and collaboration, while weekends are reserved for trains, trails, and photography. Slovenia’s compact size makes it easy to move from city life to untouched nature in just a few hours, reinforcing the sense that growth happens both professionally and personally.

Living abroad for an extended period reshapes perspective. Each hike, conversation, and project meeting contributes to a deeper understanding of how work, culture, and environment intertwine. Slovenia has proven to be more than a destination — it is a place that encourages curiosity, balance, and intentional living.

> We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.  

This journey is not only about building experience for the future, but also about embracing uncertainty, learning from a new context, and collecting moments that extend far beyond the internship itself.
