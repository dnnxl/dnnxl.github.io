## What Are Graphs?

Graphs are a fundamental mathematical structure for representing **complex systems**. At their core, a graph is composed of a set of entities, called **nodes** (or *vertices*), and a set of **edges** that encode relationships between them. Unlike representations that focus solely on individual entities, graphs explicitly model the **interactions, dependencies, and structure** of a system.

This relational viewpoint, combined with their expressive power, makes graphs a highly versatile tool across many domains.

#### Examples
- **Social networks:** Nodes represent individuals, and edges denote relationships such as friendships or interactions.
- **Biology:** Nodes may correspond to proteins, while edges represent biochemical or functional interactions.

## Why Graphs?

Unlike **tabular data** or **grid-structured data** (e.g., images or text), graphs naturally encode both **entities and their relationships**. This makes them particularly well suited for domains where connectivity and interdependence are central, including:
- social and communication networks,
- molecular and biological systems,
- knowledge graphs,
- transportation and infrastructure networks.

## What Is a Graph?

Before applying machine learning techniques to graph-structured data, we first introduce a formal definition.

### Formal Definition

A graph is defined as  
\begin{equation}
G = (V, E),
\end{equation}
where:
- $$(V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\})$$ is a finite set of **nodes** (vertices), and  
- $$(E \subseteq V \times V)$$ is a set of **edges**, representing relationships between nodes.

An edge connecting nodes $$(u, v \in V)$$ is denoted by $$((u, v) \in E)$$.

In this README, we primarily consider **simple, undirected graphs**, which satisfy:
- At most one edge exists between any pair of nodes.
- Self-loops (edges of the form $$(u, u)$$) are not allowed.
- Edges are **undirected**, meaning:
  \begin{equation}
  (u, v) \in E \iff (v, u) \in E.
  \end{equation}

---

## Adjacency Matrix Representation

A common and convenient representation of a graph is the **adjacency matrix**
\begin{equation}
A \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times |V|}.
\end{equation}

To construct the adjacency matrix:
1. Assign each node $$(v_i \in V)$$ a unique index $$(i \in \{1, \dots, |V|\})$$.
2. Define the matrix entries as:
   \begin{equation}
   A_{uv} =
   \begin{cases}
   1, & \text{if } (u, v) \in E, \\
   0, & \text{otherwise}.
   \end{cases}
   \end{equation}

Key properties:
- For **undirected graphs**, the adjacency matrix is **symmetric**:
  \begin{equation}
  A_{uv} = A_{vu}.
  \end{equation}
- For **directed graphs**, symmetry is not required, as edge direction is preserved.

---

## Weighted Graphs

In many real-world applications, edges carry additional information in the form of **weights**, which may represent strength, cost, similarity, or capacity. In this case, the adjacency matrix becomes:
\begin{equation}
A_{uv} \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation}

For example, in a **protein–protein interaction network**, an edge weight may encode the confidence or intensity of interaction between two proteins, rather than a simple binary connection.

# Multi-Relational Graphs

Graphs are powerful structures for representing complex systems. Beyond the classical distinction between **undirected**, **directed**, and **weighted** graphs, many real-world problems require modeling **multiple types of relationships** between nodes. These are known as **multi-relational graphs**.

---

## 📌 What Are Multi-Relational Graphs?

In multi-relational graphs, edges are associated with **relation types**. Instead of representing an edge simply as a pair of nodes \((u, v)\), we extend the notation to:

\[
(u, \tau, v) \in E
\]

where:
- \(u, v \in V\) are nodes,
- \(\tau \in R\) is a relation (or edge) type,
- \(R\) is the set of all relation types.

Each relation type \(\tau\) can be represented by its own **adjacency matrix** \(A_\tau\). Collectively, the entire graph can be represented as an **adjacency tensor**:

\[
A \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times |R| \times |V|}
\]

This representation allows us to model rich relational structures, such as different types of interactions between the same entities.

---

## 🧬 Example: Drug–Drug Interaction Graphs

In biomedical applications, nodes may represent **drugs**, and edges may represent different **side effects** that occur when two drugs are taken together. Each side effect corresponds to a different relation type, making this a natural example of a multi-relational graph.

---

## 🧩 Types of Multi-Relational Graphs

Two important subclasses of multi-relational graphs are **heterogeneous graphs** and **multiplex graphs**.

---

### 🔹 Heterogeneous Graphs

In **heterogeneous graphs**, nodes themselves have **types**. The node set is partitioned into disjoint subsets:

\[
V = V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \dots \cup V_k \quad \text{where } V_i \cap V_j = \varnothing \text{ for } i \neq j
\]

Edges are constrained by node types. Typically, only certain node-type combinations are allowed for a given relation type:

\[
(u, \tau_i, v) \in E \Rightarrow u \in V_j,\; v \in V_k
\]

#### Example: Biomedical Heterogeneous Graph
- **Node types**: proteins, drugs, diseases  
- **Edge types**:
  - *treats*: drug → disease
  - *polypharmacy side-effect*: drug ↔ drug

#### Multipartite Graphs

A special case of heterogeneous graphs where edges **only connect nodes of different types**:

\[
(u, \tau_i, v) \in E \Rightarrow u \in V_j,\; v \in V_k,\; j \neq k
\]

---

### 🔹 Multiplex Graphs

In **multiplex graphs**, the graph is decomposed into **multiple layers**, each corresponding to a different relation type.

Key assumptions:
- Every node exists in **every layer**
- Each layer represents **one intra-layer relation**
- **Inter-layer edges** may connect the same node across layers

#### Example: Transportation Network
- **Nodes**: cities  
- **Layers**:
  - Air transportation
  - Train transportation
- **Intra-layer edges**: connections between cities using the same mode
- **Inter-layer edges**: switching transportation modes within the same city

Multiplex graphs are particularly useful for modeling **multi-modal systems** where entities participate simultaneously in multiple types of interactions.
