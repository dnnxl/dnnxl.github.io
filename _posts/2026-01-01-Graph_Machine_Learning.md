## What are Graphs?

Graphs are a very common way to describe **complex systems**. At their core, a graph is just a set of objects, called **nodes**, and the connections between them, called **edges**.

#### Examples
- **Social networks:** nodes represent people, and edges represent friendships between them.
- **Biology:** nodes may represent proteins, while edges describe how these proteins interact with each other.

### Why Graphs?
Unlike **tabular** or **grid-based data** (such as images or text), graphs explicitly encode **relationships** and **structure**, making them well suited for modeling connected and relational data.
