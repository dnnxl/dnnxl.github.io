Based in a vibrant academic and research environment, my days are shaped by hands-on work, collaboration, and learning, while weekends invite exploration beyond the office.</p> <p>From the charming streets of <strong>Ljubljana</strong> to the alpine landscapes of <strong>Triglav National Park</strong>, Slovenia offers a rare balance between innovation and nature. Evenings often end with walks along the Ljubljanica River, conversations over local food, and planning the next short escape — whether to the coast, the mountains, or a hidden village. Inspiration comes not only from work, but also from the rhythm of daily life in a new culture.</p> <h4 id="adventure-highlights">Adventure highlights</h4> <ul> <li>Exploring Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj</li> <li>Discovering local cafés and cultural events</li> </ul> <p>Balancing structured research work with spontaneous travel has been both challenging and rewarding. Weekdays are filled with focused problem-solving and collaboration, while weekends are reserved for trains, trails, and photography. Slovenia’s compact size makes it easy to move from city life to untouched nature in just a few hours, reinforcing the sense that growth happens both professionally and personally.</p> <hr/> <p>Living abroad for an extended period reshapes perspective. Each hike, conversation, and project meeting contributes to a deeper understanding of how work, culture, and environment intertwine. Slovenia has proven to be more than a destination — it is a place that encourages curiosity, balance, and intentional living.</p> <blockquote> <p>We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.</p> </blockquote> <p>This journey is not only about building experience for the future, but also about embracing uncertainty, learning from a new context, and collecting moments that extend far beyond the internship itself.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="experiences"/><category term="internship"/><category term="travel"/><category term="slovenia"/><category term="research"/><category term="adventure"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[spring months in Slovenia — research, travel, and outdoor adventures]]></summary></entry></feed>
