At their core, a graph is composed of a set of entities, called <strong>nodes</strong> (or <em>vertices</em>), and a set of <strong>edges</strong> that encode relationships between them. Unlike representations that focus solely on individual entities, graphs explicitly model the <strong>interactions, dependencies, and structure</strong> of a system.</p> <p>This relational viewpoint, combined with their expressive power, makes graphs a highly versatile tool across many domains.</p> <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Social networks:</strong> Nodes represent individuals, and edges denote relationships such as friendships or interactions.</li> <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Nodes may correspond to proteins, while edges represent biochemical or functional interactions.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="why-graphs">Why Graphs?</h2> <p>Unlike <strong>tabular data</strong> or <strong>grid-structured data</strong> (e.g., images or text), graphs naturally encode both <strong>entities and their relationships</strong>. This makes them particularly well suited for domains where connectivity and interdependence are central, including:</p> <ul> <li>social and communication networks,</li> <li>molecular and biological systems,</li> <li>knowledge graphs,</li> <li>transportation and infrastructure networks.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="what-is-a-graph">What Is a Graph?</h2> <p>Before applying machine learning techniques to graph-structured data, we first introduce a formal definition.</p> <h3 id="formal-definition">Formal Definition</h3> <p>A graph is defined as<br/> \begin{equation} G = (V, E), \end{equation} where:</p> <ul> <li>\(\(V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}\)\) is a finite set of <strong>nodes</strong> (vertices), and</li> <li>\(\(E \subseteq V \times V\)\) is a set of <strong>edges</strong>, representing relationships between nodes.</li> </ul> <p>An edge connecting nodes \(\(u, v \in V\)\) is denoted by \(\((u, v) \in E\)\).</p> <p>In this README, we primarily consider <strong>simple, undirected graphs</strong>, which satisfy:</p> <ul> <li>At most one edge exists between any pair of nodes.</li> <li>Self-loops (edges of the form \(\((u, u)\)\)) are not allowed.</li> <li>Edges are <strong>undirected</strong>, meaning: \begin{equation} (u, v) \in E \iff (v, u) \in E. \end{equation}</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="adjacency-matrix-representation">Adjacency Matrix Representation</h2> <p>A common and convenient representation of a graph is the <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> \begin{equation} A \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times |V|}. \end{equation}</p> <p>To construct the adjacency matrix:</p> <ol> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Assign each node \(\(v_i \in V\)\) a unique index $$(i \in {1, \dots,</td> <td>V</td> <td>})$$.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li>Define the matrix entries as: \begin{equation} A_{uv} = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \text{if } (u, v) \in E, <br/> 0, &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} \end{equation}</li> </ol> <p>Key properties:</p> <ul> <li>For <strong>undirected graphs</strong>, the adjacency matrix is <strong>symmetric</strong>: \begin{equation} A_{uv} = A_{vu}. \end{equation}</li> <li>For <strong>directed graphs</strong>, symmetry is not required, as edge direction is preserved.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="weighted-graphs">Weighted Graphs</h2> <p>In many real-world applications, edges carry additional information in the form of <strong>weights</strong>, which may represent strength, cost, similarity, or capacity. In this case, the adjacency matrix becomes: \begin{equation} A_{uv} \in \mathbb{R}. \end{equation}</p> <p>For example, in a <strong>protein–protein interaction network</strong>, an edge weight may encode the confidence or intensity of interaction between two proteins, rather than a simple binary connection.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="research"/><category term="graph-machine-learning"/><category term="graph-neural-networks"/><category term="gnn"/><category term="representation-learning"/><category term="machine-learning"/><category term="deep-learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personal study notes and insights on Graph Machine Learning, covering core concepts, models, and practical considerations for learning on graph-structured data.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">From Lab to Lakes: An Internship Adventure in Slovenia</title><link href="https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From Lab to Lakes: An Internship Adventure in Slovenia"/><published>2025-10-31T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-31T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia/"><![CDATA[<p>This spring marks the beginning of an exciting chapter: combining a research internship in <strong>Slovenia</strong> with the opportunity to explore one of Europe’s most diverse and nature-rich countries. Based in a vibrant academic and research environment, my days are shaped by hands-on work, collaboration, and learning, while weekends invite exploration beyond the office.</p> <p>From the charming streets of <strong>Ljubljana</strong> to the alpine landscapes of <strong>Triglav National Park</strong>, Slovenia offers a rare balance between innovation and nature. Evenings often end with walks along the Ljubljanica River, conversations over local food, and planning the next short escape — whether to the coast, the mountains, or a hidden village. Inspiration comes not only from work, but also from the rhythm of daily life in a new culture.</p> <h4 id="adventure-highlights">Adventure highlights</h4> <ul> <li>Exploring Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj</li> <li>Discovering local cafés and cultural events</li> </ul> <p>Balancing structured research work with spontaneous travel has been both challenging and rewarding. Weekdays are filled with focused problem-solving and collaboration, while weekends are reserved for trains, trails, and photography. Slovenia’s compact size makes it easy to move from city life to untouched nature in just a few hours, reinforcing the sense that growth happens both professionally and personally.</p> <hr/> <p>Living abroad for an extended period reshapes perspective. Each hike, conversation, and project meeting contributes to a deeper understanding of how work, culture, and environment intertwine. Slovenia has proven to be more than a destination — it is a place that encourages curiosity, balance, and intentional living.</p> <blockquote> <p>We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.</p> </blockquote> <p>This journey is not only about building experience for the future, but also about embracing uncertainty, learning from a new context, and collecting moments that extend far beyond the internship itself.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="experiences"/><category term="internship"/><category term="travel"/><category term="slovenia"/><category term="research"/><category term="adventure"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring months in Slovenia]]></summary></entry></feed>
