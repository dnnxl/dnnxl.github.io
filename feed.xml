At their core, a graph is composed of a set of entities, called <strong>nodes</strong> (or <em>vertices</em>), and a set of <strong>edges</strong> that encode relationships between them. Unlike representations that focus solely on individual entities, graphs explicitly model the <strong>interactions, dependencies, and structure</strong> of a system.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_diagram_example-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_diagram_example-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_diagram_example-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_diagram_example.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Graph with vertices and nodes components. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_diagram_example-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_diagram_example-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_diagram_example-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_diagram_example.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption mt-2"> Graph Vertices and Nodes </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_labels-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_labels-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_labels-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/graph_labels.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption mt-2"> Graph edges and features labels </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/subgraphs-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/subgraphs-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/subgraphs-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post/graph_machine_learning/subgraphs.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption mt-2"> Subgraphs </div> </div> </div> <p>This relational viewpoint, combined with their expressive power, makes graphs a highly versatile tool across many domains.</p> <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Social networks:</strong> Nodes represent individuals, and edges denote relationships such as friendships or interactions.</li> <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Nodes may correspond to proteins, while edges represent biochemical or functional interactions.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="why-graphs">Why Graphs?</h2> <p>Unlike <strong>tabular data</strong> or <strong>grid-structured data</strong> (e.g., images or text), graphs naturally encode both <strong>entities and their relationships</strong>.

The relationship between two nodes is <strong>bidirectional</strong>, meaning that if node (u) is connected to node (v), then (v) is also connected to (u).</p> <p>[ (u, v) \in E \iff (v, u) \in E ]</p> <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p> <ul> <li>No direction associated with edges</li> <li>Adjacency matrix is symmetric</li> <li>Common in social or physical interaction networks</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example:</strong><br/> Friendship networks, where friendship is mutual.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="-directed-graphs">🔹 Directed Graphs</h3> <p>In <strong>directed graphs</strong> (also called <em>digraphs</em>), edges have a direction.

In this case, the adjacency matrix becomes: \begin{equation} A_{uv} \in \mathbb{R}. \end{equation}</p> <p>For example, in a <strong>protein–protein interaction network</strong>, an edge weight may encode the confidence or intensity of interaction between two proteins, rather than a simple binary connection.</p> <h1 id="multi-relational-graphs">Multi-Relational Graphs</h1> <p>Graphs are powerful structures for representing complex systems. Beyond the classical distinction between <strong>undirected</strong>, <strong>directed</strong>, and <strong>weighted</strong> graphs, many real-world problems require modeling <strong>multiple types of relationships</strong> between nodes. These are known as <strong>multi-relational graphs</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="-what-are-multi-relational-graphs">📌 What Are Multi-Relational Graphs?</h2> <p>In multi-relational graphs, edges are associated with <strong>relation types</strong>. Instead of representing an edge simply as a pair of nodes ((u, v)), we extend the notation to:</p> <p>[ (u, \tau, v) \in E ]</p> <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>(u, v \in V) are nodes,</li> <li>(\tau \in R) is a relation (or edge) type,</li> <li>(R) is the set of all relation types.</li> </ul> <p>Each relation type (\tau) can be represented by its own <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> (A_\tau). Collectively, the entire graph can be represented as an <strong>adjacency tensor</strong>:</p> <p>[ A \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times |R| \times |V|} ]</p> <p>This representation allows us to model rich relational structures, such as different types of interactions between the same entities.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="-example-drugdrug-interaction-graphs">🧬 Example: Drug–Drug Interaction Graphs</h2> <p>In biomedical applications, nodes may represent <strong>drugs</strong>, and edges may represent different <strong>side effects</strong> that occur when two drugs are taken together. Each side effect corresponds to a different relation type, making this a natural example of a multi-relational graph.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="-types-of-multi-relational-graphs">🧩 Types of Multi-Relational Graphs</h2> <p>Two important subclasses of multi-relational graphs are <strong>heterogeneous graphs</strong> and <strong>multiplex graphs</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="-heterogeneous-graphs">🔹 Heterogeneous Graphs</h3> <p>In <strong>heterogeneous graphs</strong>, nodes themselves have <strong>types</strong>. The node set is partitioned into disjoint subsets:</p> <p>[ V = V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \dots \cup V_k \quad \text{where } V_i \cap V_j = \varnothing \text{ for } i \neq j ]</p> <p>Edges are constrained by node types. Typically, only certain node-type combinations are allowed for a given relation type:</p> <p>[ (u, \tau_i, v) \in E \Rightarrow u \in V_j,\; v \in V_k ]</p> <h4 id="example-biomedical-heterogeneous-graph">Example: Biomedical Heterogeneous Graph</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Node types</strong>: proteins, drugs, diseases</li> <li><strong>Edge types</strong>: <ul> <li><em>treats</em>: drug → disease</li> <li><em>polypharmacy side-effect</em>: drug ↔ drug</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="multipartite-graphs">Multipartite Graphs</h4> <p>A special case of heterogeneous graphs where edges <strong>only connect nodes of different types</strong>:</p> <p>[ (u, \tau_i, v) \in E \Rightarrow u \in V_j,\; v \in V_k,\; j \neq k ]</p> <hr/> <h3 id="-multiplex-graphs">🔹 Multiplex Graphs</h3> <p>In <strong>multiplex graphs</strong>, the graph is decomposed into <strong>multiple layers</strong>, each corresponding to a different relation type.</p> <p>Key assumptions:</p> <ul> <li>Every node exists in <strong>every layer</strong></li> <li>Each layer represents <strong>one intra-layer relation</strong></li> <li><strong>Inter-layer edges</strong> may connect the same node across layers</li> </ul> <h4 id="example-transportation-network">Example: Transportation Network</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Nodes</strong>: cities</li> <li><strong>Layers</strong>: <ul> <li>Air transportation</li> <li>Train transportation</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Intra-layer edges</strong>: connections between cities using the same mode</li> <li><strong>Inter-layer edges</strong>: switching transportation modes within the same city</li> </ul> <p>Multiplex graphs are particularly useful for modeling <strong>multi-modal systems</strong> where entities participate simultaneously in multiple types of interactions.</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="research"/><category term="graph-machine-learning"/><category term="graph-neural-networks"/><category term="gnn"/><category term="representation-learning"/><category term="machine-learning"/><category term="deep-learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personal study notes and insights on Graph Machine Learning, covering core concepts, models, and practical considerations for learning on graph-structured data.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">From Lab to Lakes: An Internship Adventure in Slovenia</title><link href="https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From Lab to Lakes: An Internship Adventure in Slovenia"/><published>2025-10-31T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-31T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia/"><![CDATA[<p>This spring marks the beginning of an exciting chapter: combining a research internship in <strong>Slovenia</strong> with the opportunity to explore one of Europe’s most diverse and nature-rich countries. Based in a vibrant academic and research environment, my days are shaped by hands-on work, collaboration, and learning, while weekends invite exploration beyond the office.</p> <p>From the charming streets of <strong>Ljubljana</strong> to the alpine landscapes of <strong>Triglav National Park</strong>, Slovenia offers a rare balance between innovation and nature. Evenings often end with walks along the Ljubljanica River, conversations over local food, and planning the next short escape — whether to the coast, the mountains, or a hidden village. Inspiration comes not only from work, but also from the rhythm of daily life in a new culture.</p> <h4 id="adventure-highlights">Adventure highlights</h4> <ul> <li>Exploring Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj</li> <li>Discovering local cafés and cultural events</li> </ul> <p>Balancing structured research work with spontaneous travel has been both challenging and rewarding. Weekdays are filled with focused problem-solving and collaboration, while weekends are reserved for trains, trails, and photography. Slovenia’s compact size makes it easy to move from city life to untouched nature in just a few hours, reinforcing the sense that growth happens both professionally and personally.</p> <hr/> <p>Living abroad for an extended period reshapes perspective. Each hike, conversation, and project meeting contributes to a deeper understanding of how work, culture, and environment intertwine. Slovenia has proven to be more than a destination — it is a place that encourages curiosity, balance, and intentional living.</p> <blockquote> <p>We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.</p> </blockquote> <p>This journey is not only about building experience for the future, but also about embracing uncertainty, learning from a new context, and collecting moments that extend far beyond the internship itself.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="experiences"/><category term="internship"/><category term="travel"/><category term="slovenia"/><category term="research"/><category term="adventure"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring months in Slovenia]]></summary></entry></feed>
