At their core, a graph consists of a set of entities, called <strong>nodes</strong> (or vertices), and the <strong>edges</strong> that define the relationships between them. Unlike representations that focus primarily on individual entities, graphs emphasize the <strong>interactions and dependencies</strong> among elements. This relational perspective, combined with their expressive generality, makes graphs an especially versatile modeling tool.</p> <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Social networks:</strong> Nodes represent individuals, while edges capture social relationships such as friendships or interactions.</li> <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Nodes may correspond to proteins, and edges describe biochemical or functional interactions between them.</li> </ul> <h3 id="why-graphs">Why Graphs?</h3> <p>Unlike <strong>tabular</strong> data or <strong>grid-structured</strong> data (e.g., images or text), graphs explicitly encode both <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>relationships</strong>. This makes them particularly well suited for modeling systems where connectivity and interdependence play a central role, such as networks, molecules, knowledge bases, and communication systems.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-graph">What Is a Graph?</h2> <p>Before exploring machine learning techniques on graphs, it is useful to formalize what we mean by <strong>graph-structured data</strong>.</p> <h3 id="formal-definition">Formal Definition</h3> <p>A graph is formally defined as<br/> [ G = (V, E), ] where:</p> <ul> <li>(V) denotes a set of <strong>nodes</strong> (vertices), and</li> <li>(E) denotes a set of <strong>edges</strong> representing connections between pairs of nodes.</li> </ul> <p>An edge connecting node (u \in V) to node (v \in V) is written as ((u, v) \in E).</p> <p>In many applications, we focus on <strong>simple graphs</strong>, which satisfy the following conditions:</p> <ul> <li>There is at most one edge between any pair of nodes.</li> <li>Self-loops (edges from a node to itself) are not allowed.</li> <li>All edges are <strong>undirected</strong>, meaning: [ (u, v) \in E \iff (v, u) \in E. ]</li> </ul> <h3 id="adjacency-matrix-representation">Adjacency Matrix Representation</h3> <p>One common and convenient way to represent a graph is through an <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> [ A \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times |V|}. ]</p> <p>The construction of this matrix proceeds as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Assign each node a unique index corresponding to a row and column.</li> <li>Define the entries of the matrix as: [ A[u, v] = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } (u, v) \in E, <br/> 0 &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} ]</li> </ol> <ul> <li>For <strong>undirected graphs</strong>, the adjacency matrix (A) is <strong>symmetric</strong>.</li> <li>For <strong>directed graphs</strong>, symmetry is not required, as edge directionality is preserved.</li> </ul> <h3 id="weighted-graphs">Weighted Graphs</h3> <p>In many real-world scenarios, edges carry additional information in the form of <strong>weights</strong>, reflecting the strength, cost, or capacity of a connection. In such cases, the adjacency matrix entries take real values: [ A[u, v] \in \mathbb{R}. ]</p> <p>For instance, in a <strong>protein–protein interaction network</strong>, edge weights may quantify the strength or confidence of interaction between two proteins.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="research"/><category term="graph-machine-learning"/><category term="graph-neural-networks"/><category term="gnn"/><category term="representation-learning"/><category term="machine-learning"/><category term="deep-learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personal study notes and insights on Graph Machine Learning, covering core concepts, models, and practical considerations for learning on graph-structured data.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">From Lab to Lakes: An Internship Adventure in Slovenia</title><link href="https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From Lab to Lakes: An Internship Adventure in Slovenia"/><published>2025-10-31T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-31T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dnnxl.github.io/blog/2025/Slovenia/"><![CDATA[<p>This spring marks the beginning of an exciting chapter: combining a research internship in <strong>Slovenia</strong> with the opportunity to explore one of Europe’s most diverse and nature-rich countries. Based in a vibrant academic and research environment, my days are shaped by hands-on work, collaboration, and learning, while weekends invite exploration beyond the office.</p> <p>From the charming streets of <strong>Ljubljana</strong> to the alpine landscapes of <strong>Triglav National Park</strong>, Slovenia offers a rare balance between innovation and nature. Evenings often end with walks along the Ljubljanica River, conversations over local food, and planning the next short escape — whether to the coast, the mountains, or a hidden village. Inspiration comes not only from work, but also from the rhythm of daily life in a new culture.</p> <h4 id="adventure-highlights">Adventure highlights</h4> <ul> <li>Exploring Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj</li> <li>Discovering local cafés and cultural events</li> </ul> <p>Balancing structured research work with spontaneous travel has been both challenging and rewarding. Weekdays are filled with focused problem-solving and collaboration, while weekends are reserved for trains, trails, and photography. Slovenia’s compact size makes it easy to move from city life to untouched nature in just a few hours, reinforcing the sense that growth happens both professionally and personally.</p> <hr/> <p>Living abroad for an extended period reshapes perspective. Each hike, conversation, and project meeting contributes to a deeper understanding of how work, culture, and environment intertwine. Slovenia has proven to be more than a destination — it is a place that encourages curiosity, balance, and intentional living.</p> <blockquote> <p>We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.</p> </blockquote> <p>This journey is not only about building experience for the future, but also about embracing uncertainty, learning from a new context, and collecting moments that extend far beyond the internship itself.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="experiences"/><category term="internship"/><category term="travel"/><category term="slovenia"/><category term="research"/><category term="adventure"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring months in Slovenia]]></summary></entry></feed>
