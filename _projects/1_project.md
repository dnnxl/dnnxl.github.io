This project focuses on **automatic text simplification in Spanish**, aiming to improve readability, accessibility, and knowledge dissemination, especially for specialized and technical texts.

We explore approaches based on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning**, including dataset creation, text complexity analysis, and evaluation of simplified outputs.
