I'm a Master’s student in Computer Science with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. My research interests focus on AI applications in biodiversity, agriculture, biomedicine, and accessibility, as well as on diffusion models and foundation models. Recently, I have been working on multiple object tracking, object detection, and pattern recognition, while also exploring the use of foundation models and large language models for domain-specific tasks.
