I joined the [Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnología (CeNAT)](https://www.cenat.ac.cr/en/) as a researcher for a 10-month project focused on video object detection in agricultural environments. The project applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze drone and ground-based video data, aiming to improve automated agricultural monitoring and yield estimation.
