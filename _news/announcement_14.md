I successfully defended my Master’s thesis entitled **“Object Detection on Image and Video from Drone Agriculture Data using Deep Learning”** as part of the **Master’s Degree in Computer Science** at the [**Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica**](https://www.tec.ac.cr/). The thesis was supervised by [**Dr. Fabián Fallas Moya, PhD**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j02Fj8EAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=3), and it was awarded the highest academic distinction, **Summa Cum Laude**, in recognition of its excellence and contribution to the application of deep learning techniques for agricultural drone data analysis.
