I successfully defended my Master’s thesis, **“Object Detection on Image and Video from Drone Agriculture Data using Deep Learning,”** for the **Master’s Degree in Computer Science** at the [Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica](https://www.tec.ac.cr/). Supervised by [Dr. Fabián Fallas Moya, PhD](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j02Fj8EAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=3), the work received the highest academic distinction, **Summa Cum Laude**.
