I successfully defended my Master’s thesis entitled **“Object Detection on Image and Video from Drone Agriculture Data using Deep Learning”** as part of the **Master’s Degree in Computer Science** at the **Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica**. The thesis was supervised by **Dr. Fabián Fallas Moya, PhD**, and it was awarded the highest academic distinction, **Summa Cum Laude**, in recognition of its excellence and contribution to the application of deep learning techniques for agricultural drone data analysis.
