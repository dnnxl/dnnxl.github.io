I recently joined the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia as a research assistant in the [Computer Vision Laboratory](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratory/lrv-26), led by Professor Peter Peer and supervised by Blaž Meden. My current work focuses on diffusion models and generative modeling for biometric de-identification.
