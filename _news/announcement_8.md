At the Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnolog√≠a (CeNAT), I served as a Course Instructor for the **Big Data School 2020**, where I delivered the workshop *"Machine Learning Methods and Deep Learning with Images"*, teaching practical applications of these techniques with image data and contributing to capacity building in data science within the national research and education community.
