  abstract = {Pint of Signal Sips is an outreach initiative inspired by the Pint of Science movement and adapted to Costa Rica’s scientific community. Designed as an accessible platform, it brings together students, professionals, and researchers in signal processing and related disciplines to exchange ideas in an informal setting. The inaugural edition was held on November 26, 2024, at the bar in Escazú, as a prelude to CONCAPAN 2024, attracting over 60 participants from across Latin America. The event featured engaging 10-minute talks on diverse topics including artificial intelligence, biomedical devices, conservation, and smart cities, delivered by distinguished speakers from Costa Rica, Mexico, and Ecuador. Beyond knowledge dissemination, Pint of Signal Sips fostered collaboration across IEEE societies, encouraged the formation of new Signal Processing chapters, and strengthened regional networks. By presenting science in “sips,” the initiative highlights the importance of signal processing while promoting inclusivity, community building, and innovation.}
