  abstract = {Pint of Signal Sips is an outreach initiative inspired by the Pint of Science movement and adapted to Costa Rica’s scientific community. Designed as an accessible platform, it brings together students, professionals, and researchers in signal processing and related disciplines to exchange ideas in an informal setting. The inaugural edition was held on November 26, 2024, at the bar in Escazú, as a prelude to CONCAPAN 2024, attracting over 60 participants from across Latin America. The event featured engaging 10-minute talks on diverse topics including artificial intelligence, biomedical devices, conservation, and smart cities, delivered by distinguished speakers from Costa Rica, Mexico, and Ecuador. Beyond knowledge dissemination, Pint of Signal Sips fostered collaboration across IEEE societies, encouraged the formation of new Signal Processing chapters, and strengthened regional networks. By presenting science in “sips,” the initiative highlights the importance of signal processing while promoting inclusivity, community building, and innovation.}

  abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to change the way we used to handle education in our homes, through sanitary restrictions that seek to prohibit or reduce physical contact, moving from the traditional way to a virtual methodology; reason for which we must look for new solutions to adapt to this new teaching strategy. In addition, the pandemic has accelerated the arrival of the 4.0 revolution or technological revolution, where new challenges arise for society. The above reasons serve to justify and encourage that STEM education cannot stop. However, given the crisis we are experiencing and the solutions provided, the excessive use of virtual environments can affect areas such as psychological, social, etc. Through this project, a learning model implemented through volunteers is proposed, based on an interactive semi-virtual environment, where the participant can interact synchronously with a volunteering model provided by the volunteer tutor, and the learning process is supported through workshops and the use of virtual tools.},
